	<h3>Welcome!</h3>

	<p>Hello there, and welcome to my Co-op Portfolio. The purpose of this website is for me to share and give context to my previous Co-op work term experiences. Specifically, to explain my role and responsibilities to understand what the hours of 9 to 5 were like for me during these past four months. Follow along and pay attention! As this website will show you what I consider the most rewarding and growing experiences of not only my career, but my life!<br>

	I am a Co-op student at the University of Guelph, in the process of attaining a bachelor of computing in software engineering, along with a minor in marketing. I am currently a 3rd year student and have just completed my first work term which allowed me to expand my skillset further than I could imagine possible in only just four months!
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
	<p>The University of Guelph Co-op program offers incredible opportunities. The Co-op program offers the tools and support
	to learn about the work place relating to your program, along with providing ways to apply the knowledge you learned in the classroom
	to real world scenarios. I was exposed to many of the technologies that are dominating the software development world today, allowing me to 
	expand my skillset and build my resume. I can confidently say, so far my expirence in the Co-op program has been one of the most
	rewarding and valuable expirences in my life, and I am eager to learn what the Co-op program has in-store for me in the future! </p>

	<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
  	<p>There have been many individuals both in and outside the University of Guelph community that have helped me get to where I am today. However, I must give a special thank you to my Co-op coordinators, Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts, for the support they have given me during this entire process. Thanks to Kate, I now have a professional and stream-lined resume that I am confident to present to employers! Laura has always been a huge help in answering my questions and concerns as well as guiding me in the right direction no matter the time of day! Kate and Laura are truly valuable assests to the University of Guelph Co-op program!</p>
