            <br><h3>About Sandbox Software Solutions</h3>
            <p>Sandbox Software Solutions is a local company that is devoted to developing quality websites, mobile applications, or anything to satisfy your software needs. Sandbox was founded 15 years ago by two University of Guelph Co-op students, Devin Gauthier and Mark George. Today, Sandbox employs 15 people ranging from software developers to graphic designers, and continues to grow their workforce and client base, with the majority of Sandbox's clients being in the not-for-profit sector. The majority of Sandbox's business is building beautiful websites, using a proprietary content management system called <a href="http://www.oasiscms.com">Oasis</a>, built by the founders of the company.</p>

            <br><h3>Learning Goals</h3>
            <p>In the first weeks of working at Sandbox Software Solutions, I outlined three clear goals that I deemed were applicable to my role at Sandbox, along with some personal goals I have had for some time. These goals consisted of both skills I wanted to learn and that I considered would be beneficial to my future as a software developer. I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of all things web development. Specifically, becoming proficient at developing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but also doing it correctly along the way. This meant all websites I would be developing would have to meet World Wide Web Compliance and accessibility standards.</p>

                                <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                                <p>With effective communication being so crucial in the software development world, I made it a goal of mine to strengthen my communication skills. I saw strong communication as a tool I needed in my bag in order to effectively explain processes or ideas to either co-workers or clients.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                                <p>Shadow fellow co-workers to understand effective ways to communicate with clients, while also using my current knowledge on requirements gathering.</p>

                                <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                                <p>I communicate with clients in an effective manner and can be relied on by the team to do such a task successfully.</p>

                                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                <p>While it was not my job to be in direct contact with clients, I had to relay the same information to the project managers, a task where communication is just as important. I feel I particularly excelled in this area, as I was constantly required to explain how requirements would need to be implemented, give details into any problems that arose, and explain where the project currently stood during our Tuesday and Thursday meetings. Due to having consistent effective communication, I was entrusted to document the status of the project at each completed task. This documentation was relied on by project managers to give updates to clients on where their website stood in terms of completion.</p>

                            Goal #2 - Learn how to build beautiful websites that comply with AODA and W3C standards.

                            <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                            <p>While building beautiful websites is great and all, all of that work may be for nothing if they don't comply with certain standards. Specifically, <a href="https://www.aoda.ca">AODA</a> are standards set to help people with disabilities navigate a website, and <a href="https://www.w3.org">W3C</a> are standards set to ensure the technical quality of web pages and well-formed markup. Important practices I needed to know in order to be effective at web development.</p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                            <p>Use online tools to confirm my work is compliant with these standards.</p>

                            <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                            <p>All my work does in fact meet AODA and W3C standards and I can fulfill the role as an effective team member / junior web developer.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>During my time at Sandbox, every website I built complied with the AODA and W3C standards, as required by Sandbox. I was able to accomplish this by using online tools like <a href="https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">A-Checker</a> and <a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3C Validator</a>, as well as some inside tools exclusive to Sandbox. In addition, every website I built was mobile friendly as well, making for ease of use on any screen size.</p>

                            <p>My goal for my Co-op experience was to get a taste of as many different technologies as possible. I saw websites as one of those important technologies in today's world that would be beneficial in knowing how to create. Therefore, I wanted to walk away from this job knowing I can effectively do so.</p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                            <p>Have a strong and motivated work ethic along with asking questions when needed.</p>

                            <p>Web development is one of the strongest skills I possess, along with being proficent in Oasis and Wordpress.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>Going into this job I knew some things about web development, but within my first week, I realized I've barely scratched the surface. I was quite surprised with how much there was to web development, specifically with compliance standards. However, I can now say web development is one of the strongest tools in my bag. Within the first month, I was relied on to quickly turn around work requests (updates or additions to existing client websites) within the hour. While doing it beautifully, complying with standards, and having it mobile friendly.</p>

            <br><h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p>During my time at Sandbox Software Solutions, I held the position of Junior Web Developer. This meant I built, styled, and populated the websites with content. I primarily used <a href="http://www.oasiscms.com">Oasis</a> to get the job done, a proprietary content management system created by Sandbox. My role at Sandbox consisted of taking specifications given by the client, a design created by our graphic designer, and writing a few lines of code to make it all come together. While building each website, the majority of my time was spent styling the websites with CSS to match the provided design, as well as implementing the functionality of some custom features by either using Velocity within the HTML or using Javascript. Thanks to <a href="http://www.oasiscms.com">Oasis</a>, the majority of the markup for the overall website is taken care of, allowing developers to spend more time making the website pixel perfect.<br><br>

            When my time was not focused on a single website, I would be handling work requests. Work requests are small updates to clients websites, an example being as simple as changing the background of a page or adding a new feature altogether. I particularly enjoyed the larger work requests due to the fact that they didn't come with the regular procedure that a new website had. Specifically, work requests didn't come with a design, meaning I could take the requirements and come up with my own way of getting the job done, allowing me to get creative, which is something I enjoy.<br><br>

            I walked into Sandbox on my first day thinking I had a decent grasp of web development, and while I did know the fundamentals, I was surprised by how much I didn't know. Specifically, with web compliances. Never would I have thought that it matters that an H2 header cannot come before an H1 header, or that photos need to have the "alt" tag for screen readers, small things like this shook up my world. Ultimately, I conquered this learning curve and have become a confident and reliable Junior Web Developer as a result.<br><br>


            Here are two examples of currently live websites that I have worked on, built using Oasis!<br><br>
