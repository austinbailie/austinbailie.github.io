            <br><h3>About RevyooMe</h3>
            <p>RevyooMe (pronouced, review me) is a small start-up founded recently in the last year here in Guelph, Ontario.  The company was founded by Mark Graham, a local Guelph Real-Estate Lawyer, who was looking for a review based app that was applicable to his law firm. When the search for such an application came up empty, Mr. Graham decided to build such a product him self. Enlisting the help of two Guelph Computing students and four Waterloo Computing students, all of which who expressed an interest in mobile app development, to create the review based application for iOS and Android Mr. Graham had envisioned, with the goal of one day giving companies like Yelp a run for their money.</p>

            <br><h3>Learning Goals</h3>
            <p>In the first weeks of working at RevyooMe, I outlined three clear goals that I deemed were applicable to my role at RevyooMe along with some personal goals I have had for some time. The three goals are as follows:<br>
            <br>- To more thoroughly document my completion of coding tasks.
            <br>- Continually meet weekly set tasks.
            <br>- Fully learn how to build and integrate a database with iOS.<br><br>
            These goals consisted of both skills I wanted to learn and that I considered would be beneficial to my future as a software developer. Specifically, to strengthen my knowledge of the iOS developer enviroment and the Swift language to become proficcient at developing mobile applications for iOS. In addition, strengthening the basic traits that every software developer should have, including documentation of code and to meet tasks on time. With that, I can confidently say I have succesfully completed all three of these goals.</p>

            <br><h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p>At RevyooMe, 90% of the time was spent developing for iOS and the other 10% was spent working in the backend to integrate our database and backend functions into the iOS app. My time developing for iOS was spent creating the overall user interface and integrating the functionality of the app, from the homepage of our app which displays content posted by other users to the users profile page containing various types of information. My time in the backend was used to develop serverless functions using Amazon Web Services Lambda that would be used to populate the front-end with content.</p>
