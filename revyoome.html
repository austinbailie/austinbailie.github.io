            <br><h3>About RevyooMe</h3>
            <p>RevyooMe (pronouced, review me) is a small start-up founded recently in the last year here in Guelph, Ontario. The company was founded by Mark Graham, a local Guelph Real-Estate Lawyer, who was looking for a review based app that was applicable to his law firm. When the search for such an application came up empty, Mr. Graham decided to build such a product him self. Enlisting the help of two Guelph Computing students and four Waterloo Computing students, all of which who expressed an interest in mobile app development, to create the review based application for iOS and Android Mr. Graham had envisioned, with the goal of one day giving companies like Yelp a run for their money. Due to RevyooMe being so young, much of the information I have about the product I worked on is considered private and unfortunately can not share. </p>

            <br><h3>Learning Goals</h3>
            <p>In the first weeks of working at RevyooMe, I outlined three clear goals that I deemed were applicable to my role at RevyooMe along with some personal goals I have had for some time. These goals consisted of both skills I wanted to learn and that I considered would be beneficial to my future as a software developer. Specifically, to strengthen my knowledge of the iOS developer enviroment and the Swift language to become proficcient at developing mobile applications for iOS. In addition, strengthening the basic traits that every software developer should have, including documentation of code and to meet tasks on time.</p>

                                Goal #1 - To more thoroughly document my completion of coding tasks.

                    <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">

                                <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                                <p>I chose to make this a goal of mine due to the importance that
                                documenting your code has in the software development world. I knew
                                my time at RevyooMe would be a short four months, and that someone new
                                would replace me after that. Therefore, I wanted to ensure a smooth transition into
                                the iOS developer role and hoped the documentation of my work would aid
                                in such a process.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                                <p>To use the tools of Phabricator (used for project management) more effectively to track coding progress.</p>

                                <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                                <p>My code is documented well enough that is read and understood easily by peers.</p>

                                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                <p>I feel my documentation of my code met the standards I had set for myself when
                                I first wrote this goal. In my final week at RevyooMe, the majority of my time was focused on
                                writing Wiki's in Phabricator explaining how to use proccesses in our backend, along going through
                                my code to clean up any unclear comments. This was all to ensure everything was easily
                                understood for the next developer in line.</p>

                            <h4>Goal Description</h4>
                            <p>The team and I at RevyooMe were tasked with producing a beta version
                            of the app for iOS and Android by the end of August. This meant it was paramount
                            that we set our weekly goals appropriately and even more so to meet them.</p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                            <p>Outline key steps that are crucial to the completion of said task in Monday sprint planning meetings.</p>

                            <h4>Measure of Success</h4>
                            <p>All tasks are successfully completed on time.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>While a beta version of the app was not ready by the end of August due
                            to some changes within the app, we came pretty close to it. All originaly set tasks
                            were completed on time, and if no changes had been made, the goal of having a beta by
                            the end of August would have been met!</p>

                            <p>I have always had a keen interest in developing for iOS. Therefore,
                            I decided to make a personal goal of mine, a work term goal too. My intention with this
                            goal was to learn how to have an iOS app communicate with a backend service such
                            as a database. Due to the complexity of the project ahead of me at the time, this personal goal
                            of mine fit perfectly as a work term goal as well.</p>

                            <h4>Action Plan</h4>

                            <p>I had our iOS app communicating with our backend service hosted by Amazon Web Services 
                            within the first month. Allowing us to query our database for a variety of information, along with
                            pulling media content from our Amazon S3 Bucket that was used to store our videos and pictures.</p>

            <br><h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p>At RevyooMe, I held the position as the main iOS Developer. 90% of my time was spent developing for iOS and the other 10% was spent working in the backend to integrate our database and backend functions into the iOS app. My time developing for iOS was spent creating the overall user interface and integrating the functionality of the app, from the homepage of our app which displays content posted by other users to the users profile page containing various types of information. My time in the backend was used to develop serverless functions using Amazon Web Services Lambda that would be used to populate the front-end with content.<br><br>

            My favourite part about my role at RevyooMe was the freedom we were given to create. Specfically, with how the user interface of app looked and behaved. A task was handed out to us with a general idea and an end result, and we were free to fill in the rest. This resulted in really interesting user interface designs, not only in how they looked but also how they functioned. Totally unique from any applications currently in the marketplace.<br><br>

            My first day at RevyooMe almost felt like my first day of school. I had no knowledge of the technologies the would be needed in order to
            build an app of this magnitude, and I know I speak for the entire RevyooMe team as well. While I personally have had some expirence developing for iOS before, it was equivalent to knowing how to count to ten compared to what I would need to know to make this app happen.
            However, because of this, I can confidently say I have never had a more rewarding learning expirence. During my time at RevyooMe, I was hands on with one of the industry leading technologies for backend services, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>. We used the tools that Amazon Web Services offered to host our SQL database using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_CAsc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%7CPS-GO%7CBrand%7CDesktop%7CSU%7CDatabase%7CRDS%7CCA%7CEN%7CText&sc_content=rds_e&sc_detail=amazon%20rds&sc_category=Database&sc_segment=293604591528&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=CA&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!293604591528!e!!g!!amazon%20rds&ef_id=W5BWngAACHHKFevR:20180913001918:s">Amazon RDS</a>. We also used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_CAsc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%7CPS-GO%7CBrand%7CDesktop%7CSU%7CCompute%7CLambda%7CCA%7CEN%7CText&sc_content=lambda_e&sc_detail=aws%20lambda&sc_category=Compute&sc_segment=293599127904&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=CA&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!293599127904!e!!g!!aws%20lambda&ef_id=W5BWngAACHHKFevR:20180913002121:s">AWS Lambda</a> as our serverless backend where we built the functions that would query our database for the needed information. To provide login functionality, we used
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_CAsc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%7CPS-GO%7CNon-Brand%7CDesktop%7CSU%7CSecurity%7CCognito%7CCA%7CEN%7CText&sc_content=cognito_p&sc_detail=cognito&sc_category=Security&sc_segment=293638221043&sc_matchtype=p&sc_country=CA&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!293638221043!p!!g!!cognito&ef_id=W5BWngAACHHKFevR:20180913002359:s">Amazon Cognito</a> as a secure way to have user profiles and store that user information. Finally, we used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_CA&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=api_gateway_b&sc_content=api_gateway_e&sc_detail=amazon%20gateway%20api&sc_category=api_gateway&sc_segment=161192823789&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=CA&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!161192823789!e!!g!!amazon%20gateway%20api&ef_id=W5BWngAACHHKFevR:20180913002527:s">Amazon API Gateway</a> to tie together all the services
            previous mentioned. This created for us a downloaded SDK that could be implemented into our iOS and Android applications, allowing us to
            connect to our backend services within our app.
